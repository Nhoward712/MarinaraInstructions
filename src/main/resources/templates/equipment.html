         <p>For major equipment, all you need is a good quality heat source.  A stovetop range is suitable as
            long as it has good temperature control on it.  Additional equipment (Figure 1.): An eight quart
            stock pot, a cutting board, a quality chefâ€™s knife, a clean towel (this could get messy), a pound scale,
            a wooden spoon, measuring cups, tongs, a large bowl, a food mill, and a six quart pot.  With the stock pot,
            make sure that the bottom is at least 3/16th inches thick to help prevent scorching.  This procedure uses a
            food mill, but a food processor will work as well.  Keep in mind that a food mill will remove the tomato
            seeds which will help keep your sauce from getting bitter. </p>
